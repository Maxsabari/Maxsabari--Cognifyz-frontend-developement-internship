Interactive Web Development Project
This project demonstrates interactive and responsive web development techniques using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Sass. It showcases basic webpage structure, responsive design, form validation, and integration of CSS preprocessing with Sass.

Project Features
Basic HTML Structure: Includes common elements such as headers, paragraphs, images, and forms.
Inline CSS Styling: Styling is applied directly within HTML elements for quick experimentation.
Responsive Design: Ensures proper layout across different screen sizes using media queries.
Interactive Button: A button that changes the background color of the page when clicked.
API Integration: Fetches data from an external API (JSONPlaceholder) and dynamically displays the fetched content.
Form Styling & Validation: The project features a contact form with proper styling and client-side validation.
Component-Based Styling: Utilizes Bootstrap for modular components.
CSS Preprocessing with Sass: Organizes and enhances stylesheets using variables, nesting, and more.
Project Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-web-development.git
cd interactive-web-development
2. Install Sass
To compile the Sass files into CSS, you need to have Sass installed on your machine.

Install Sass using npm:

npm install -g sass

3. Compile the Sass
Once Sass is installed, compile the styles.scss file into styles.css.

sass styles.scss styles.css

Alternatively, you can use the following command to watch for changes and automatically compile the file when you make updates:

sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css

4. Open the Project
Once everything is set up, open the index.html file in your browser:

open index.html
Or simply double-click the index.html file to open it in your default browser.

Key Features and Components
HTML
Defines the structure of the webpage.
Includes a contact form, header, navigation bar, and footer.
Utilizes an image from Unsplash to enhance visual appeal.
CSS & Sass
Sass is used for better code organization.
Variables: Store reusable values (e.g., color, font sizes).
Nesting: Simplifies structure and readability.
Mixin and functions: (Not implemented in this example but can be added for further extensibility).
JavaScript
Form Validation: Ensures that the form fields (name, email, message) are filled out before submission.
Background Color Change: A button that changes the background color of the page when clicked.
Fetching Data from an API: Integration with JSONPlaceholder to display dynamic posts.
Technologies Used
HTML5 for markup
CSS3 for styling
Sass for CSS preprocessing
JavaScript for interactivity
Bootstrap for layout and components
JSONPlaceholder API for data fetching
Future Improvements
Add more dynamic features, such as displaying user comments or posts.
Implement advanced validation for email and other form fields.
Expand the form to include additional input types such as phone numbers or checkboxes.
Improve accessibility (e.g., adding ARIA labels, roles).
Set up a build tool like Webpack or Gulp for automated CSS compilation.
